<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>I am a very simple introverted person who loves her own space. I love to read and teach as well. I love watching movies but sadly have no time for it anymore.</p>

<p>My favourite genre of anything is probably horror, mistery and thriller.</p>

<p>Not much to say about me, though you'd have a great time if you met me in person...just saying.</p>
